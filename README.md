# Titanic EDA

This lab is all about Pandas and plotting. We will be taking a look at the Titanic manifest. I will be exploring the data to see what we can learn regarding the survival rates of different groups of people.

## Dataset

The dataset has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and stored in a CSV.
